  <h2>Graphic Designer & Developer</h2>


<p>I am a self-motivated and progress-driven individual with an extensive
  background in this industry. With a long-standing record of initiative and
  innovation. Throughout the course of my career, I have honed my communication
  skills and teamwork abilities. I am an astute problem-solver capable of prioritising
  and managing complex projects with proficiency. In my current experience as Code Nation
  student, being exposed to software such as HTML, CSS and Python, has boosted my confidence
  and skillsets in working individually or as a team to brainstorm and coordinate effort to
  achieve a goal and create a strong portfolio.
